# Build a Markdown Previewer
**Objective:** Build a [CodePen.io](https://codepen.io) app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/JXrLLE/.
#### User stories:
  1. I can type GitHub-flavored Markdown into a text area.
  2. I can see a preview of the output of my markdown that is updated as I type.
